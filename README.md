# PHP Photo Gallery
**Beamtic PHP Gallery** takes advantage of PHP's build-in capabilities and file-handling to create a modern image gallery, allowing us to create categories, upload images, and organize them into categories.

There is a live demo available at the website.

## August 2025 update:

- Added a setup process
- Switched to password_hash() instead of md5
- Made it possible to upload images to the root "/" folder, so you no longer need to create categories to upload images

**Known issues:**

- Some strings are not translated. Will fix this soon.
- Included files can be accessed directly (depending on server setup). Will fix soon.
- "gallery/" is sometimes unwanted in the URL of images. It should just start from "/"..

**to-do:**
- Allow adding image titles and text descriptions
- Allow uploading plain text files
- Allow uploading video files
- Add pagination
- Improve the translation system

## Requirements
The gallery requires GD library to, among other things, create thumbnails from uploaded images. Some hosts will already have this installed by default. If your host does not have it installed, it is recommend you either shift to cloud hosting, or find a shared host that does have it installed.

Some hosts already handle permissions by default, others will not. In the latter case, you will have to change permissions on your own (I.e.: chown & chmod). If this is not possible, change to another hosting provider!

You might also need to change the **upload_max_filesize** and **post_max_size** in php.ini, but again, sometimes your hosting will already allow you to upload larger files. Obviously, it is bad to upload big image files because they generally take too long time to load, and they will slow down the gallery for your visitors. It is recommended you resize images before uploading.

## Installation
Installing the photo gallery is simple. You can either download a **.7z** file from the project website (phpphotogallery.com), or you can clone this git repository.

After extracting the zip and moving the files to your server, you just need to add the usual permissions with **chmod**. _*I.e:* chmod 777 -R /var/www/mysite/gallery/_

It is recommended that you setup groups instead of just allowing everyone (777), so instead you may want to do something like:
> sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/mysite/gallery/

> sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/mysite/gallery/

The photo gallery relies on gdlib. If your server does not already have it installed, you may be able to install it with the following command:

>sudo apt-get install php7.0-gd

**Note.** The above is just an example, the exact steps required on your own setup might be different. Some shared hosts will not need any modifications to permissions. In addition, you might also need to adjust the **upload_max_filesize** and **post_max_size** settings in _php.ini_. Have fun!
